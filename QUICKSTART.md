# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Your App is Now Running!

**URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## ✅ What's Fixed

Your Shiny chat app now uses **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** via OpenRouter instead of Gemini, which means:
- ✅ **MCP tools work perfectly**
- ✅ **Sales data tool** is fully functional
- ✅ **Automatic chart generation** when sales data is requested

## 🎮 Try It Out

1. Open the app in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000

2. Type any of these messages:
   - "Show me sales data for 3 products"
   - "Get sales figures for 5 products"
   - "I need sales data for 10 products"

3. Watch as:
   - 📝 Claude responds with the data
   - 📊 A beautiful Plotly chart appears automatically!

## 🔧 What Changed

**Before** (Broken):
```python
from chatlas import ChatGoogle
llm = ChatGoogle(model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp")
# MCP tools registered but Gemini can't see them ❌
```

**After** (Working):
```python
from chatlas import ChatOpenRouter
llm = ChatOpenRouter(model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet")
# MCP tools work perfectly ✅
```

## 📊 Chart Features

When you request sales data:
1. Claude calls the `get_sales_data` MCP tool
2. Tool returns JSON data
3. App automatically parses the data
4. Creates a Plotly bar chart
5. Displays both text response AND chart

## 🐛 The Bug We Found

MCP tools don't work with Google Gemini in chatlas 0.13.2:
- Gemini sees tools as `_call()` instead of actual names
- Affects ALL Gemini models (2.0, 2.5, Pro, Flash)
- Works fine with Claude, GPT-4o, and Llama

See `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` for full details and test evidence.

## 📝 Files

- `app.py` - Main Shiny application (now using Claude)
- `mcp_sales_server.py` - FastMCP server with sales data tool
- `test_*.py` - Test files proving the Gemini bug
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete analysis and findings

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test the app with various sales data requests
2. Try different numbers of products (1-20)
3. Multiple requests create multiple charts
4. Use "Clear Chat" button to reset

Enjoy your working MCP-powered chat app! 🎉
